# Task 3 - SQL for Data Analysis

This repository contains my submission for Task 3 of the Data Analyst Internship.  
The objective was to analyze ecommerce data using SQL and perform various operations like filtering, joining tables, grouping, and using subqueries.

- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
- INNER JOIN, GROUP BY
- Aggregate functions: SUM, COUNT
- Subqueries
- Views

The queries helped extract useful insights like:
- Customers from the USA
- Revenue by country
- Details of each order
- High-value customers
